# icon-carousel
A simple vanilla JS script for an interactive, rotating icon carousel.  

*Any feedback is appreciated! Leave a star if you found it useful!* :)

#### Some things to note:
- The current version of the carousel works with icons from the `iconify-icon` library.  
- Most (if not all) aspects of the carousel are customizable, but may need some tweaking to work properly.
